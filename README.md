SlitherDoc is a lightweight, near-Universal Markdown Documentation Generator.

SlitherDoc follows its own philosophy of documentation where the structure of your project also doubles as the "Documentation" of your project.
The projects file structure can double as a static site
For example, `library.c` would have a `library.c.md` file in the same directory, which should document everything in `library.c`.

Most programming languages use slashes( / ), hashes( # ) or dashes( - ) for single line comments, so SlitherDoc uses exactly that, keyword is "Most", so if your programming language does not use the above for single line comments, im very sorry.

# How to use
Look into `docgen_config.py` to learn how to use this generator
